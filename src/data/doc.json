  "introduction": [
    "South American and Mesoamerican civilizations have fascinated me since childhood, when I would watch <em><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysterious_Cities_of_Gold>The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a></em>. This early 1980s Japanese-French anime series featured a solar-powered galleon ship, a golden, mechanical condor, three kids exploring the <em>New World</em> at the beginning of the Spanish Conquest, and a mini documentary at the end of each episode. Who could ask for more? (There was even a <a href=https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Myst%C3%A9rieuses_Cit%C3%A9s_d%27or_(s%C3%A9rie_t%C3%A9l%C3%A9vis%C3%A9e_d%27animation,_2012)>sequel in 2012!</a>)",
    "But, despite this enchantment, Quetzalcoatl and Tlaloc were the only gods I could identify, while I could name dozens of Greek, Egyptian or Norse Gods. Only ten years ago, I learned about Aztec codices and a whole world of deities, each taking care of some aspects of human life.",
    "Using these codices, I tried to identify them all, like a Pokemon chaser, despite scattered, partial and sometimes contradictory sources. I finally collected and restored illustrations of more than a hundred gods.",
    "Through these illustrations, I hope to commemorate the complexity of the Aztec Pantheon, make the academic research more accessible, and show how this civilization is still alive in our global culture. With luck, they will also help you see this society with the wonderment of your inner child’s eyes, just like I did all those years ago."
