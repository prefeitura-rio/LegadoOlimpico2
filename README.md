# Data

**2 steps**

- Download the source file `src/data/gods/raw/light-db.tsv` from [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19BskUgohmPi5cZPRRct9RLiSl3fSDXhwQAQcXtCoSNk/edit#gid=0](this Google Spreadsheet) (owned by Gwendal Uguen),
- `npm run make-layout` will create the data file actually used in the app. `nodes.json` contains all information about Gods, plus layout coordinates calculated using d3-force.

# Svelte Starter

This [starter template](https://github.com/the-pudding/svelte-starter) aims for fast and easy web development speficially for data-driven and visual stories. It is an opinionated template built on top of [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

_Please Note: do not use or reproduce The Pudding logos or fonts without written permission._

_Prettier Formatting: Disable any text editor Prettier extensions to take advantage of the built-in rules._

#### Features

- [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) for simple/easy svg icons
- [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) for micro-CMS powered by Google Docs and Sheets
- [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) for CSS/JS style parity
- CSV, JSON, and SVG imports by default
- SSR static-hosted builds

## Quickstart

New school: just click the `Use this template` button above.

Old school:

```bash
npx degit the-pudding/svelte-starter my-project
```

Then in your local repo:

`npm install` or `pnpm install`

## Development

To start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Modify content in `src` and `static/assets`.

## Deploy

If you are hosting the project on a subdirectory, set it in `package.json` under the `pudding.subdirectory` property. Example: `https://pudding.cool/2021/01/test` then put `"subdirectory": "/2021/01/test"`.

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a directory called `build` with the server-side rendered static-hostable app.

If deploying to github pages:

```bash
make github
```

## Style

There are a few stylesheets included by default in `src/styles`. Put anything global in `app.css`. For variable parity in both CSS and JS, modify files in the `properties` folder using the [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/) API.

You can use SCSS or another CSS preprocessor by installing the module (eg. `node-sass`) and including the property in the svelte-preprocess in `svelte.config.cjs`.

## Google Docs and Sheets

- Create a Google Doc or Sheet
- Click `Share` button -> advanced -> Change... -> to "Anyone with this link"
- In the address bar, grab the ID - eg. ...com/document/d/**1IiA5a5iCjbjOYvZVgPcjGzMy5PyfCzpPF-LnQdCdFI0**/edit
- paste in the ID above into `google.config.cjs`, and set the filepath to where you want the file saved
- If you want to do a Google Sheet, be sure to include the `gid` value in the url as well

Running `npm run gdoc` at any point (even in new tab while server is running) will fetch the latest from all Docs and Sheets.

## Notes

Any @html tags, e.g., `{@html user}` must be the child of a dom element so they can be properly hydrated.
